# My thoughts on Neum

## Documentation
* [+] Main uses cases and examples in the landing page are well structured and well documented. 
* [--] Once you start exploring the APIs and documentation more it starts to become harder to follow and most of the blocks under ["Supported Blocks"](https://docs.tryneum.com/docs/blocks#supported-blocks) lack good documentation. They seem very intersting but I need more concrete examples on how to set them up and how they can be used in a workflow. I'm thinking [this](https://docs.tryneum.com/docs/qa-with-a-document) level of detail but for each block would be ideal.
* [-] Very minimal but... the JSON in some examples[[1]](https://docs.tryneum.com/docs/qa-with-a-document)[[2]](https://docs.tryneum.com/docs/qa-with-a-document) is not properly formatted and this can bring a bad experience for developers who are trying to get started quickly and are simply copy pasting the examples you give
* [++] The integrated tooltip que tienen en estas paginas [[1]](https://docs.tryneum.com/reference/run-workflow)[[2]](https://docs.tryneum.com/reference/create-workflow)esta increible. Idk if that is out of the box or what but being able to generate the starter code for various languages is really cool. 
    * If at some point you guys create wrapper libraries for Neum fuera bien cool si ese widget tambien pudiera dar ejemplos de como correr los workflows etc con el wrapper o con raw http requests.
* [--] For a fair amount of your examples specifically when there is a "Request"/"Response" section, the request body and the response body don't go together/don't make sense. This can be very confusing for your users and can be off putting. Ex: https://docs.tryneum.com/reference/create-workflow 
    * Obvio entiendo que estan un "beta testing" phase y getting features out y likely a lot more important than making sure there are no mistakes in your docs pero I thought I would point it out anyways. Al final del dia aunque sea un beta test entre amigos the website is publicly hosted and there is nothing stopping people from actually stumbling across your product.
